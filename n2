//I found that to initilize functions they must not be spaced over at all. But if I want to use functions
//then they cannot be within main, so they have to be outside of it, but that means that my variables
//have to be global, so I initialize them outside of the functions, but for some reason the array can't intitialize
//Any ideas???
